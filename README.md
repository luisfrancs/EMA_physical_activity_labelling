# EMA_PA_Data_Labelling

This code was developed to label accelerometer data collected in the context of the WEALTH  study (Wearable sensors for the assessment of physical and eating behaviours). 
classification. The analysis integrates wearable sensor data with Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) prompts to generate sparsely labelled data to train machine learning algorithms for physical activity classification. Analysis presented in the manuscript "Data Labelling for Free-Living Physical Activity Recognition using Thigh-Worn Wearables and Event-based Ecological Momentary Assessment".
Label evaluation was carried-on using Matlab and the machine learning experiments where carried-on using Python.
